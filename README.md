# ActuallyAnAgenda
Our submission / idea for TOHacks 2020 (May 2-3).

# Description
In essence, our program is meant to be a task scheduler / agenda which allows users to enter their daily tasks based on several customizable factors, such as due date and time required, and our program will automatically create a personalized schedule that one can follow!

The one and only agenda which actually accommodates to your procrastination habits!

We utilize several algorithms which attempt to measure habits of a user based on task completions, such as the aforementioned procrastination, as well as other key factors such as best work hours, break times, and so on! 

Although such a task ended up being unfinished for the time requirement of this hackathon, we plan on bringing this program forward and finishing / expanding it in the near future.
